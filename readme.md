# 🧼 casCSSade 🫧

A clean classless classy cascading style sheet for a lil' pazazz you need on the go.

## Superiors

- [Tacit](https://github.com/yegor256/tacit) (I stole your html page to test against thx🙇🏿‍♂️🙏🏿)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/): it may not be classless but it's my personal favourite and adds some nice buff in base (without classes)
- [concrete](https://concrete.style/): solid base and beautiful B/W styling, I like it
- [MVP](https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp/): it's got some *opinions* but it's good especially if want easy to use components

## opinions 🤮

I tried to keep the sizing and overall look and feel of the page as close to browser defaults as possible (which I think is sexy in its own way).
But with some intentional markup changes beautiful pages a cascade away.

- nest inputs in labels: this makes the fullwidth -- hence nicer
